Using two Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in a multi-tier architecture, such as a web tier and an application tier, provides several benefits and is a common design pattern for improving scalability, security, and manageability. Hereâ€™s why you might see this setup:

### Reasons for Using Two ELBs in a Multi-Tier Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - **Web Tier ELB:** Handles incoming traffic from clients, distributing it to the web servers in the web tier.
   - **App Tier ELB:** Handles traffic between the web servers and the application servers, distributing it to the app servers in the application tier.

2. **Scalability:**
   - **Horizontal Scaling:** Each tier can be scaled independently. You can scale the web tier separately from the application tier, optimizing resource usage and cost.
   - **Load Distribution:** Each ELB distributes the load across its respective tier, ensuring efficient handling of traffic spikes and balancing the load.

3. **Security:**
   - **Segmentation:** By using separate security groups for each tier, you can apply more granular security policies.
   - **Isolation:** Traffic between tiers is isolated, minimizing the attack surface and controlling access between different parts of the application.

4. **Performance:**
   - **Optimized Routing:** Each ELB can be optimized for its specific use case. For example, the web tier ELB can be optimized for handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic, while the app tier ELB can be optimized for handling internal application traffic.

5. **Flexibility:**
   - **Different Protocols and Ports:** Each tier can handle different types of traffic and protocols. The web tier might handle HTTP/HTTPS, while the application tier might handle TCP/UDP traffic.
   - **Fault Isolation:** Faults in one tier do not directly impact the other, improving the overall resilience of the architecture.

### Example Scenario

**Architecture Overview:**

1. **Web Tier:**
   - **Web Tier ELB:** Distributes incoming client traffic to multiple web servers.
   - **Web Tier SG:** Security group for web servers allowing traffic from the Web Tier ELB and blocking other unnecessary traffic.

2. **Application Tier:**
   - **App Tier ELB:** Distributes traffic from the web servers to the application servers.
   - **App Tier SG:** Security group for application servers allowing traffic from the App Tier ELB and blocking other unnecessary traffic.

3. **Data Tier:**
   - **Data Tier SG:** Security group for database servers, only allowing traffic from the application servers.

**Traffic Flow:**
1. **Client to Web Tier ELB:** The client sends a request to the Web Tier ELB.
2. **Web Tier ELB to Web Tier SG:** The Web Tier ELB forwards the request to the web servers in the Web Tier SG.
3. **Web Server to App Tier ELB:** The web server processes the request and forwards it to the App Tier ELB.
4. **App Tier ELB to App Tier SG:** The App Tier ELB distributes the request to the application servers in the App Tier SG.
5. **App Server to Data Tier:** The application server processes the request and communicates with the database servers in the Data Tier SG.

### Summary

Using two ELBs in a multi-tier architecture provides several benefits:
- **Separation of concerns:** Different ELBs handle traffic at different tiers.
- **Scalability:** Independent scaling of web and application tiers.
- **Security:** Granular control and isolation of traffic between tiers.
- **Performance:** Optimized handling and routing of different types of traffic.
- **Flexibility:** Support for different protocols and fault isolation.

This architecture ensures efficient, secure, and scalable handling of traffic within a multi-tier application, aligning with best practices for cloud-native application design.
