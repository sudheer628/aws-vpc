In the context of AWS VPC route tables, "explicit subnet associations" and "subnets without explicit associations" refer to how subnets are associated with route tables, determining which route table's rules are applied to the subnet.

### Explicit Subnet Associations

**Definition:**
Explicit subnet associations occur when a specific subnet is manually associated with a particular route table. This means you explicitly define which route table governs the routing for the subnet.

**Characteristics:**
- **Manual Association:** You manually associate the subnet with a specific route table.
- **Route Table Selection:** The subnet uses the routes defined in the explicitly associated route table.
- **Control:** Provides precise control over which routing rules apply to the subnet.

**Example Scenario:**
- You have a public subnet that you want to explicitly associate with a route table that has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW).
- You manually associate this subnet with the route table configured for public internet access.

### Subnets Without Explicit Associations

**Definition:**
Subnets without explicit associations are those subnets that are not manually associated with any specific route table. Instead, they default to using the main route table for the VPC.

**Characteristics:**
- **Default Association:** These subnets use the main route table of the VPC by default.
- **Automatic Assignment:** If a subnet is not explicitly associated with a specific route table, it automatically inherits the routes from the main route table.
- **Simpler Management:** Useful for simpler VPC setups where you want multiple subnets to share the same routing rules without manually associating each one.

**Example Scenario:**
- You have several private subnets that you want to use the same routing rules defined in the main route table.
- You do not manually associate these subnets with any specific route table, so they automatically use the main route table.

### Key Differences

| Feature                        | Explicit Subnet Associations                          | Subnets Without Explicit Associations            |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Association Method**         | Manually associated with a specific route table       | Automatically uses the main route table          |
| **Control**                    | Precise control over which route table applies        | Simplifies management by using the default route table |
| **Use Case**                   | When you need specific routing rules for a subnet     | When you want multiple subnets to share the same routing rules |
| **Route Table Changes**        | Changes to the associated route table affect only the explicitly associated subnets | Changes to the main route table affect all subnets without explicit associations |

### Example Configuration

**Explicit Subnet Association:**
1. Create a route table (e.g., for public subnets).
2. Add a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW) in this route table.
3. Manually associate the public subnet with this route table.

**Subnets Without Explicit Associations:**
1. Configure the main route table (default) with necessary routes (e.g., routes to a NAT Gateway for private subnets).
2. Do not manually associate subnets with any specific route table.
3. These subnets will automatically use the main route table.

### Steps to Associate Subnets Explicitly

1. **Open the VPC Console:**
   - Go to the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

2. **Select Route Tables:**
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Route Tables."
   - Select the route table you want to associate with a subnet.

3. **Edit Subnet Associations:**
   - Click on the "Subnet Associations" tab.
   - Click the "Edit subnet associations" button.
   - Select the subnets you want to associate explicitly with this route table.
   - Save the changes.

### Summary

- **Explicit Subnet Associations:** Subnets manually associated with a specific route table, providing precise control over routing rules.
- **Subnets Without Explicit Associations:** Subnets that automatically use the main route table, simplifying management by applying the same routing rules.

By understanding and using explicit subnet associations and subnets without explicit associations effectively, you can design and manage your VPC routing configurations to meet your networking requirements.
