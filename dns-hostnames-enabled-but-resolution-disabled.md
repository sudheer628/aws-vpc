When creating a VPC, if you disable DNS resolution and enable DNS hostnames, the following outcomes will occur:

### Outcomes

1. **DNS Hostnames Enabled:**
   - Instances in the VPC will receive DNS hostnames.
   - If instances have public IP addresses, they will receive corresponding public DNS hostnames (e.g., `ec2-203-0-113-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com`).
   - Instances will also receive internal DNS hostnames based on their private IP addresses (e.g., `ip-10-0-0-1.ec2.internal`).

2. **DNS Resolution Disabled:**
   - Instances will not be able to use the Amazon-provided DNS server to resolve domain names.
   - Internal DNS hostnames (e.g., `ip-10-0-0-1.ec2.internal`) and public DNS hostnames (e.g., `ec2-203-0-113-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com`) will not resolve to their respective IP addresses.

### Implications

1. **Internal Communication:**
   - Instances will have DNS hostnames, but these hostnames will be non-functional because DNS resolution is disabled. Therefore, instances will not be able to communicate with each other using these hostnames.
   - You will need to use private IP addresses for internal communication between instances.

2. **External Communication:**
   - Instances will not be able to resolve external domain names (e.g., `www.example.com`), which means they won't be able to connect to external services or websites using domain names.
   - External communication would need to be established using IP addresses directly, which is impractical and not recommended.

3. **Service Integration:**
   - AWS services that rely on DNS resolution, such as Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, and others, will not function correctly because instances cannot resolve the service endpoints.
   - Integration with these services will be hindered.

4. **Hybrid Environments:**
   - In a hybrid cloud setup, instances within the VPC will not be able to resolve DNS names for on-premises resources or other VPCs.
   - This could disrupt communication and service discovery in multi-environment deployments.

### Example Scenario

1. **Public Subnet with Web Server:**
   - A web server instance in a public subnet has a public IP address `203.0.113.25` and a corresponding public DNS hostname `ec2-203-0-113-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com`.
   - Because DNS resolution is disabled, the DNS hostname will not resolve to the public IP address. Users trying to access the web server using the DNS hostname will not be able to reach it.

2. **Private Subnet with Backend Service:**
   - A backend service instance in a private subnet has a private IP address `10.0.1.10` and a corresponding internal DNS hostname `ip-10-0-1-10.ec2.internal`.
   - Because DNS resolution is disabled, the internal DNS hostname will not resolve to the private IP address. The web server in the public subnet will need to use the private IP address `10.0.1.10` to communicate with the backend service.

### Summary

- **DNS Hostnames Enabled, DNS Resolution Disabled:**
  - Instances receive DNS hostnames, but these hostnames are non-functional because DNS resolution is disabled.
  - Internal and external communication using domain names will not work, severely limiting the usability and integration capabilities of the instances.

In most cases, you want both DNS resolution and DNS hostnames to be enabled to ensure seamless internal and external communication, proper service integration, and ease of management within your VPC. Disabling DNS resolution while enabling DNS hostnames creates a situation where the provided hostnames cannot be resolved, leading to connectivity issues and management challenges.
